    <h3>Basics:</h3>

        <p>All HTML code starts with less than on the left and greather than
            symbol on the right.</p>    
        <p>Each section of code is divided up into elements.</p>
        <p>The elements have a start and end section.</p>
        <p>The start and end elements have the same names (example: head and head).</p>
        <p>The start section of the elements has the less than and
            greater than symbols. (&#60; &#62;)</p>
        <p>The end section has a slash / symbol just after the less than sign.</p>
        <p>The first element will require: !DOCTYPE html
            This is required above the html element.</p>
        <p>The second element is html. All code goes between the html
            start and end element.</p>
        <p>You should include the language attribute (example: html lang="en")
            in your html element that matches the 
            language the website is written in.</p>
        <p>The next section is head. Head statnds for headder and
            goes at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>Inside head it will need the meta element (meta charset="UTF-8")</p>
        <p>The next section is the body section. This section has most of the 
            information that will appear on the website.</p>
        <p>Inside the body you can have a section header starting with h1-h6.</p>
        <p>The element p is used for Paragraph and is used for
            Paragraph string text.</p>

    <h3>Extentions:</h3>
    

        <p>vscode-icons is an extention in Visual Studio Code that 
            allows you to use certain icons in Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>If you search for github theme you will find the extetnion
            for GitHub Theme for an improved Visual Studio Code appearance.</p>
        <p>Live Server is another extention but this one is usually needed for
            viewing webpages.</p>
        <p>Once the Live Server extention is installed you can right click and
            choose Open with Live Server to open in a webpage.</p>

    <h3>Intro to CSS:</h3>

        <p>The style element allows you to change the style of text in
            the webpage. This element starts after the title and before
        the body section.</p>

        <img src="StyleElementCodeExample.JPG" alt="StyleElementCodeExample"> 

        <p>CSS is the look of HTML and the style element is for
            adding CSS code to the HTML.</p>
        <p>font-size: numberpx is used to adjust the font-size
            (the nuberic size you want for your font to be. Example: 22px).</p>
        <p>The brackets with a pointy middle section
             contain the style elements.
            example: {font-size numberpx} (number being the font size.)</p>
        <p>background-color: is used to change the background color of the webpage.</p>
        <p>#333 is an example of a color. It changes the background to a
            black color.</p>
        <p>color: is another example of how you can change the color of part
            of the background.</p>
        <p>whitesmoke is an example of a color that can be used with color:
            (color: whitesmoke) It changes the color of the text to white.</p>    
        <p>The semi colon is used to seperate lines of code in CSS
            (They are not needed for standard html).</p>
        <p>CSS code typically goes inside another file seperate from the
            html code. This file is often named main.css

            The style tags do not need to be inside the main.css file.
            You can cut and paste just the code from inside the stype tag 
            into the main.css file. Remove the style element from the
            html code and add &#60;link rel=&#8220;stylesheet&#8221;
            href=&#8220;main.css&#8221; type=&#8220;text/css&#8221;&#62;</p>
        
        <p>The code to link the css file goes above the /head end head tag</p>
        <p>stylesheet refers to the main.css type.</p>

        <p>type=&#8220;text/css&#8221; refers tot the file type of the
            main.css file.

    <h3>To add an image to the website: </h3>
        <p>   first drag and drop the image into the Explorer section of Visual Studio
            Code. Then use less than, img, src, equals sign, quotation marks,
            the file path (note if this path is in the same folder as your current
            html file then you will just need the file name and type ex. path.jpg
            and end quotation mark),
            then alt, equals, quotation mark, file name, end quotation mark and

    <section id="Text Basics:">
    <h3>Text Basics:</h3>
        <p>Headings have a hierarchy. You typically only start out
            with 1 h1 on the page. Each page should only have 1
            h1.</p>
        <p>The numbers above 1 for the headers (h2-h6) are sub sections
            that there can be multiple of and divide up the page Into
            multiple sections.</p>
        <p>Typcially the higher the header numbers the more specific
        about a section topic you get (a hierarchy). 
        (The h1 for example is going to be a header for 
        the whole page, h2 would be a category of the
        page, h3 would be about a topic in the category of the page,
        h4 would be a point about the topic in the category of the page,
        h5 would be a note about the point about the topic in the
        category of the page, and h6 would be a very specific detail
        about the note about the point about the topic in the category
        of the page).</p>
        <p>You can change the header's look though css and are not
        stuck with just choosing only between the six heder sytles.</p>
        <p>hr stands for horizontial rule. It doesn't have a closing
        tag just the &#60;hr&#62;. This will add lines accross the page
         to divide up section of code.</p>
        <p>Webpages (html) does not reconize extra space you put
            at the end fo the Paragraph tags and will format 
            based on where there is text.</p> 
        <p>br stands for break and refers to a line break
            &#60;br&#62; as with hr there is no ending tag needed.</p>
        <p>Block level elements start each new section of text on a 
            new line (header, br and p are examples of block level
            characters that add space).</p>
        <p>In line level elements don't have the exta space 
            between each section of text. (Some of the below
        elements like em and strong are examples of in-line
        elements that can be used in the middle of say a Paragraph
        tag and don't add space between characters).</p>
        <p>em element: &#60;em&#62; (stands for emphasis) allows you to italicize something
            to stronger emphasis of that word (important note:
            the italicized characters have emphasis for the sake of
            websites reconizing the words are more imporant. The correct
            way to italicize a word would be through css.)</p>
        <p>strong element start, &#60;Strong&#62; 
            end, &#60;/Strong&#62; makes the text a little
        bold. </p>
        <p>html entities are things not part of the normal text
            you would still type out. Ampersand &#38; 
            is often part of these entities. 
            Because some symbols are automatically considered
            part of code you have to use special characters such as
            Ampersand to type these out. In the:
            &#8220;How to add a special character without it being confused for code:&#8221;
            Section above a link to code for special characters was given. It is also
            added here below: (note the list is incomplete and there
            are many others some of which we will go over below.)</p> 
            <a href="https://www.teachucomp.com/special-characters-in-html-tutorial/">
                List of special symbols code:</a>
        <p>entities start with Ampersand &#35; then the hashtag symbol
            &#35; followed by numbers and finally the semicolon &#59;.    
        </p>
        <p>&#38;lt&#59; is used for less than. &lt;</p>
        <p>&#38;gt&#59; is used for greater than than. &gt;</p>
        <p>&#38;copy&#59; is for the copyright symbol. &copy;</p>
        <p>&#60;abbr title=&#8220;abbreviationInformation&#8221;
             &#62; ABBREVIATION &#60;/abbr&#62; end is used for
            adding abbreviations. The start tag has title equals
            followed by the abbreviation informaiton in quotation marks then greater than
            followed by the actual abbreviation and closing tag.
            When you hover over the abbreviation in the LiveServer it will
            show the abbeviationInformation you typed between the quotation
            marks. (Hovering over the abbreviation in an actual website 
            may not show anything so don't rely on this for showing any
            important information when the website is up.)</p>

        <p>&lt;address&gt; is used for reconizing a physical address
            is being used. Whatever search engine you use will reconize
            that this is an address and change how it behaves.</p>
        <p>html comments start with a less than sign,
            exclamation mark &#33;, &lt;, four dashes
            --- and ends with a greater than sign &gt;. The note goes
            in the middle of the dashes (two dashes in).
            Example: &lt;&#33;--Note to self--&gt;
            This message can still seen online if someone knows how,
            (right click and choose inspect)
            you should therefore only put notes that won't be an issue
            if someone else online sees it.</p>

    <section id="How to create list on a webpage:">
    <h3>How to create list on a webpage:</h3>
        <p>3 types of common list: ordered list, unordered list,
        and description list.</p>
        <p>&lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt; Creates a list tag with the list
            itmes going between the start and end list tags.</p>
        <p>&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; stands for ordered list. The start ol goes before the
            li tag and ends after the last li tag to make the whole list
            ordered. There is no need for paragraph elements inside the list
            (A paragraph element will put spaces between each list number).
            Ordered list are numbered in ascending order 
            (smallest to largest). 
            These list do not have extra space like Paragraph elements
            do between each other.</p>
        <p>&lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; stands for unordered list. The paragraph
            element can be left inside an unordered list (the li start
            elements go before the start p element and the end li goes
            after the end p element). The result of an unordered 
            list is a list of bullet points that does have the extra
            space if you have paragraph elements inside the list.
        <p>&lt;dl&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; stands for description list. There are two
            different kinds of elements in a description list and instead of
            just li like in ordered and unordered list. &lt;dt&gt; &lt;/dt&gt;
            stands for description term and refers to the a list item description.
            &lt;dd&gt; &lt;/dd&gt; stands for description detail and
            goes below the dt. The dd is where the information about
            the list item in the dt is entered (like a definition of
            a word goes in the dd and the word in the dt.)
            The description detail is indented to the right
            slightly more than the description term.</p>
        <p> Example: </p>

        <p> &lt;dl&gt;</p>
        <p> &lt;dt&gt;dl&lt;/dt&gt;</p>
        <p> &lt;dd&gt;dl stands for description list.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
        <p> &lt;dt&gt;dt&lt;/dt&gt;</p>
        <p> &lt;dd&gt;dt stands for description term.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
        <p> &lt;dt&gt;dd&lt;/dt&gt;</p>
        <p> &lt;dd&gt;dd stands for description detail.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
        <p> &lt;/dl&gt;</p>

            (url) in quotation marks. Then the greater than 
            sign. This is followed by the hyperlink text for
            the viewers of the website to click on and be taken
            to the website. After that is the closing anchor tag
            &lt;/a&gt;.</p>
        <p>When the full web address is included to take you
            to a specific web address it is called an absolute
            reference.</p>
        <p>You can leave off the folder path if in the same
            folder as the file with the code (index.html)
            file (If you drag and drop the file into 
            visual studio it will be stored in the same 
            folder).</p>
        <p>If you reference a file only by name (because
            for instance it is in the same folder as 
            the code file) then you are using what is 
            called a relative reference (instead of an 
            absolute reference).</p>
        <p>You can reference another page by making
            a portion of code a relative reference.</p>
        <p>To create a relative reference start with
          the a tag, then href, followed by equals, then
          the same file name that is saved in the code
          folder in quotation marks, then the word 
          to click on to take you to the link, 
          and the end a tag (note thaty the starting a
          tag won't have the greater than sign until after
          the end quotation mark of the file name. Also,
          the file name needs the file type like .html
          for html file types.)</p>
        <p>As an example, website.html is the file name
            for the html code information on How to 
            upload HTML code to a website and is linked
            below in this documents so you can click on
            the How to upload HTML code to a website 
            (Github Pages) words below and it will take
            you to that document.</p>
        <a href="website.html">
        How to upload HTML code to a website (GitHub Pages) link
        </a>
        <p>An about.html page is common as a way of
            introducing the website author.</p>
        <p>An internal reference allows you to link to
            somewhere else on the same page.</p>
        <p>To add an internal reference we use the
            &lt;Section id=&#8220;SectionTitle&#8221;&gt; &lt;/Section&gt;
            with the SectionTitle being replaced
            with the title you want to 
            reference later in the
            code as a reference and the section 
            content you want between the 
            start and end section elements.</p>
        <p>To then reference the internal link
            you use the nav element (
            &lt;nav&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt; 
            &lt;li&gt; 
            &lt;a href=&#8220;&#35;SectionTitle&#8221;&gt;
            TextForUserToClick
            &lt;/a&gt; 
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt; 
            &lt;/nav&gt;)
        </p>
        <p>nav stands for the navigation
        element. The unordered list and 
        list item elements help organize the
        nav link. A hashtag is required in front
        of the SectionTitle for it to be reconized
        as a link. SectionTitle is whatever name
        you put int he section id= element.
        The TextForUserToClick is the text you
        want the user to click to take them to
        the linked section of the page. Since
        this format is a list you can put 
        back-to-back references using multiple
        &lt;a href=&#8220;&#35;SectionTitle&#8221;&gt;
        TextForUserToClick
        &lt;/a&gt; links.</p>

        <p>alt z allows you to wrap words allowing it to 
            extend to the next line below the current line.
            This will extend text inside quotation marks to the
            line below it.</p>
        <p>When copying text with quotation marks the quotation marks
            may not be reconized if they are a front or back quote because
            Visual Stuido Code quotation marks don't have a direction and
            the quotation marks may be considered by Visual Stuido Code to
            be a different character.</p>
        <p>shift alt down-arrow will copy the above line to directly
