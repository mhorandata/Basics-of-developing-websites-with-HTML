        <h1>Basics of developing websites with HTML.</h1>

    <br>
    <h3>Basics:</h3>

        <p>All HTML code starts with less than on the left and greather than
            symbol on the right.</p>    
        <p>Each section of code is divided up into elements.</p>
        <p>The elements have a start and end section.</p>
        <p>The start and end elements have the same names (example: head and head).</p>
        <p>The start section of the elements has the less than and
            greater than symbols. (&#60; &#62;)</p>
        <p>The end section has a slash / symbol just after the less than sign.</p>
        <p>The first element will require: !DOCTYPE html
            This is required above the html element.</p>
        <p>The second element is html. All code goes between the html
            start and end element.</p>
        <p>You should include the language attribute (example: html lang="en")
            in your html element that matches the 
            language the website is written in.</p>
        <p>The next section is head. Head statnds for headder and
            goes at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>Inside head it will need the meta element (meta charset="UTF-8")</p>
        <p>The next section is the body section. This section has most of the 
            information that will appear on the website.</p>
        <p>Inside the body you can have a section header starting with h1-h6.</p>
        <p>The element p is used for Paragraph and is used for
            Paragraph string text.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Extentions:</h3>

        <p>vscode-icons is an extention in Visual Studio Code that 
            allows you to use certain icons in Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>If you search for github theme you will find the extetnion
            for GitHub Theme for an improved Visual Studio Code appearance.</p>
        <p>Live Server is another extention but this one is usually needed for
            viewing webpages.</p>
        <p>Once the Live Server extention is installed you can right click and
            choose Open with Live Server to open in a webpage.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Intro to CSS:</h3>

        <p>The style element allows you to change the style of text in
            the webpage. This element starts after the title and before
        the body section.</p>

        <img src="StyleElementCodeExample.JPG" alt="StyleElementCodeExample"> 

        <p>CSS is the look of HTML and the style element is for
            adding CSS code to the HTML.</p>
        <p>font-size: numberpx is used to adjust the font-size
            (the nuberic size you want for your font to be. Example: 22px).</p>
        <p>The brackets with a pointy middle section
             contain the style elements.
            example: {font-size numberpx} (number being the font size.)</p>
        <p>background-color: is used to change the background color of the webpage.</p>
        <p>#333 is an example of a color. It changes the background to a
            black color.</p>
        <p>color: is another example of how you can change the color of part
            of the background.</p>
        <p>whitesmoke is an example of a color that can be used with color:
            (color: whitesmoke) It changes the color of the text to white.</p>    
        <p>The semi colon is used to seperate lines of code in CSS
            (They are not needed for standard html).</p>
        <p>CSS code typically goes inside another file seperate from the
            html code. This file is often named main.css

            The style tags do not need to be inside the main.css file.
            You can cut and paste just the code from inside the stype tag 
            into the main.css file. Remove the style element from the
            html code and add &#60;link rel=&#8220;stylesheet&#8221;
            href=&#8220;main.css&#8221; type=&#8220;text/css&#8221;&#62;</p>
        
        <p>The code to link the css file goes above the /head end head tag</p>
        <p>stylesheet refers to the main.css type.</p>

        <p>type=&#8220;text/css&#8221; refers tot the file type of the
            main.css file.
        </p>

    <h3>How to stop and start live updates goint to the server:</h3>    
            
        <p>In the bottom right of Visual Studio Code there is a 
            Port: 5500 that when clicked on will stop the server.
            Once clicked there will be a go live button to make the 
            code live again.
        </p>

    <h3>How to add a special character without it being confused for code:</h3>    

        <p>To add special characters in HTML, type an ampersand (&) followed
            by the pound sign (#), followed by the number of the code, 
            and ended with a semicolon (;)
        </p>

        <p>To add a hyperlink to a website type a or
            &#60;a&#62; and &#60;/a&#62;</p>

    <br>
    <h3>To add an image to the website: </h3>
        <p>   first drag and drop the image into the Explorer section of Visual Studio
            Code. Then use less than, img, src, equals sign, quotation marks,
            the file path (note if this path is in the same folder as your current
            html file then you will just need the file name and type ex. path.jpg
            and end quotation mark),
            then alt, equals, quotation mark, file name, end quotation mark and
            finally a greater than sign.</p>

        <p>To add a Fav icon:</p>

        <p>&#60;link rel=&#8220;icon&#8221; href=&#8220;FileName.png&#8221; 
        type=&#8220;image/x-icon&#8221;&#62;</p>
        
        <p>rel stands for relate and refers to how does the icon relate to
          the webpage. icon for instance refer to an icon relationship
         of course.</p>
        
        <p>href refers to html that stands in part for hypertext 
         and href is a hypertext reference. The file name in the 
        Visual studio code folder will go here.</p>

        <p>The type refers to the type of resource is being used. 
        image/x-icon for instance is a type.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Additional tools and help:</h3>
        <p>How to add a break: Use the br element</p>

        <p>ctrl s is used for quickly saving code in Visual Studio Code.</p> 
        <p>The Markup Validation Service will allow us to check our HTML
            for errors or issues that would have to be resolved prior to
            uploading online.</p>

        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML quality checker</a>
        <p>alt z allows you to wrap words allowing it to 
            extend to the next line below the current line.
            This will extend text inside quotation marks to the
            line below it.</p>
        <p>When copying text with quotation marks the quotation marks
            may not be reconized if they are a front or back quote because
            Visual Stuido Code quotation marks don't have a direction and
            the quotation marks may be considered by Visual Stuido Code to
            be a different character.</p>

        <h3>Additional meta tags to consider adding:</h3>
        <p>A meta tag for the webpage author is recommended.
            It stars with name=&#8221;author&#8220; followed by
             content=&#8221; &#8220; with the author's name 
             (your own name if you build this website) Inside
             the quotation marks following content=
        </p>
        <p>Another meta tag might be a description of
            the website. This would be 
            meta name=&#8221;description&#8220;
            content=&#8221; &#8220; with the description going
