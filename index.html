        <h1>Basics of developing websites with HTML.</h1>

    <br>
    <h3>Basics:</h3>

        <p>All HTML code starts with less than on the left and greather than
            symbol on the right.</p>    
        <p>Each section of code is divided up into elements.</p>
        <p>The elements have a start and end section.</p>
        <p>The start and end elements have the same names (example: head and head).</p>
        <p>The start section of the elements has the less than and
            greater than symbols. (&#60; &#62;)</p>
        <p>The end section has a slash / symbol just after the less than sign.</p>
        <p>The first element will require: !DOCTYPE html
            This is required above the html element.
        </p>
        <p>The second element is html. All code goes between the html
            start and end element.</p>
        <p>You should include the language attribute (example: html lang="en")
            in your html element that matches the 
            language the website is written in.</p>
        <p>The next section is head. Head statnds for headder and
            goes at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>Inside head it will need the meta element (meta charset="UTF-8")</p>
        <p>The next section is the body section. This section has most of the 
            information that will appear on the website.</p>
        <p>Inside the body you can have a section header starting with h1-h6.</p>
        <p>The element p is used for Paragraph and is used for
            Paragraph string text.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Extentions:</h3>

        <p>vscode-icons is an extention in Visual Studio Code that 
            allows you to use certain icons in Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>If you search for github theme you will find the extetnion
            for GitHub Theme for an improved Visual Studio Code appearance.</p>
        <p>Live Server is another extention but this one is usually needed for
            viewing webpages.</p>
        <p>Once the Live Server extention is installed you can right click and
            choose Open with Live Server to open in a webpage.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Intro to CSS:</h3>

        <p>The style element allows you to change the style of text in
            the webpage. This element starts after the title and before
        the body section.</p>

        <img src="StyleElementCodeExample.JPG" alt="StyleElementCodeExample"> 

        <p>CSS is the look of HTML and the style element is for
            adding CSS code to the HTML.</p>
        <p>font-size: numberpx is used to adjust the font-size
            (the nuberic size you want for your font to be. Example: 22px).</p>
        <p>The brackets with a pointy middle section { contain the style elements.
            example: {font-size numberpx} (number being the font size.)
        </p>
        <p>background-color: is used to change the background color of the webpage.</p>
        <p>#333 is an example of a color. It changes the background to a
            black color.</p>
        <p>color: is another example of how you can change the color of part
            of the background.</p>
        <p>whitesmoke is an example of a color that can be used with color:
            (color: whitesmoke) It changes the color of the text to white.</p>    
        <p>The semi colon is used to seperate lines of code in CSS
            (They are not needed for standard html).</p>

    <h3>How to stop and start live updates goint to the server:</h3>    
            
        <p>In the bottom right of Visual Studio Code there is a 
            Port: 5500 that when clicked on will stop the server.
            Once clicked there will be a go live button to make the 
            code live again.
