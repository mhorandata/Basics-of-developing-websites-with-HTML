    <h3>Creating a repository on github:</h3>

        <p>Go to github.com and log on. (create an account if you don't have one yet)</p>   
        <p>Next click on your icon in the upper right corner. To open the drop down menu.</p>
        <p>Select Your repositories. Repositories are like folders where files and documents can be stored.</p>
        <p>Click on new for new repository (has a little book with a bookmark icon next to it).</p>
        <p>Add a repository name that you can use to identify the repository with later.</p>
        <p>Make sure the repository is public.</p>
        <p>Leave everything else as is and click on Create repository.</p>

    <h3>Uploading code to a GitHub repository</h3>
        <p>In the Quick setup section of the new repository choose the link for &#8220;upload an existing file&#8221; 
            (You can also type /upload at the top of the repository web address)</p>
        <p>Now simply drag and drop files to the &#8220;Drag files here to add them to your repository&#8221; section
            or click on the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; hyperlink text to search for them on your computer.</p>
        <p>Don't drag the folder with the files of code into the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; section.
            Instead, only drag the files contianing the actual code into the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; section.</p>
        <p>Once files are added the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; will turn into the 
            &#8220;Drag additional files here to add them to your repository.&#8221; section.</p>     
        <p>The files should now show up below the &#8220;Drag additional files here to add them to your repository.&#8221; section.</p>
        <p>Click on &#8220;Commit changes&#8221; once you have the needed files uploaded.</p>
        
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h3>How to add the uploaded code to GitHub Pages:</h3>
        <p>From your repository's page click on Settings button in the top right.</p>
        <p>From Settings under the Code and automation section on the left choose Pages.</p>  
        <p>In GitHub Pages under the Source section in the middle click on the drop down that starts with &#8220;None&#8221; selected.</p>
        <p>In the drop-down choose &#8220;main&#8221; (It may be called something else like master but it should be the option that isn't
             &#8220;none&#8221;)</p>
        <p>Next to the drop down that now has Branch:main (unless main wasn't the name) leave the &#8220;/(root)&#8221; drop down as the default
            then click Save.</p>
        <p>The code will then publish to the internet. It make take a few minutes.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes you can refresh the page and it should say &#8220;Your site is published at&#8221; followed by a 
            hyperlink. Now anyone with that hyperlink on the internet can view our website.</p>
        <p>If you don not see the hyperlink you can also access it using your github_username.github.io/repository_name</p>
        <p>You can right click on the link in the GitHub Pages and open in a new tab to open the website in a new tab.</p>
        <p>When you open it likely it will have a 404 File not found error at this point.</p>
        <p>In the repository files you will have the names of your files. If you add a slash (/) then the name of one of the 
            files that are part of your html website and press enter it will take you to your website.</p>
        <p>The GitHub repository works the same way as the computer in that the files on GitHub in the repository link up
            using the file names found in the repository just like they do in Visual Studio Code. This is the same for 
            loading images which should be uploaded to the GitHub Repository and named as they are in Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>Steps to put the webstie on internet:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write HTML & CSS code</li>
            <li>Upload code to GitHub</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The 404 error mentioned before is because by default the website will look for a file called index.html.
            If this file is not uploaded to GitHub then it will return the error and you will have to manually add the file name.
            So to fix the problem we need to add an index.html file into our repository. You can rename a file to 
            index.html if you want that file to automatically open by default. It may take a few momenets after updating
            the name before the changes are finished loading. Once they have been updated if you refresh your website's
            page it will load without the 404 error and instead using the html code in the index.html file.</p>

    <h3>How to Set up a Domain Name:</h3>
            <p>Two steps to setting up a domain name:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Get a domain name.</li>  
              <li>Link domain name ot GitHub Pages</li>
            </ol>
        <p>You have to purchase a domain name from a Domain Registrar.</p>
        <p>Domain Registrars are companies certified to sell domain names.</p>
        <p>Domain names are not expensive.</p>
        <p>A Domain ending in .com cost $10-$15 dollars per yer.</p>
        <p>Once you register a domain name it is taken so other 
            people can't register it.</p>
        <p>namecheap is a highly recommended Domain Registar.</p>
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/promos/new-com-promo/?clickID=VxAW7AWl-xyIRHHRgsyc1zb2UkAWQYzpTQPkW00&irgwc=1&utm_source=IR&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=3110155&affnetwork=ir&ref=ir">
    namecheap link</a>
        <p>Use coupon NEWCOM598 to get a .com domain for $5.98 (33%+ OFF, new accounts only).</p>  
        <p>After using the namecheap link click on Domains at the top of the home page.</p>
        <p>In the &#8220;Find your new domain name&#8221; Search box you can look for the domain name you want.</p>
        <p>If you search for a domain name that is already registered
            it will tell you that it is already registered.</p>
        <p>If you are unsure of what to register first you can use your
            firstnamelastname.com</p>
        <p>If the .com version is taken you can also search for the .net option.</p>
        <p>If you are sticking with .com but it isn't available you can
            add something to your name like dev for developer.</p>
        <p>Once you find the one you want click on Add to cart to the
            right of the name.</p>
        <p>Once the domain name(s) are in your cart you go up to the 
            cart icon in the top right and click on View Cart.</p>               
        <p>In the cart make sure Domain Privacy is Enabled otherwise
            you will get spammed.</p>
        <p>If everything looks good click on Confirm Order.</p>
        <p>Next you will have to create a namecheap account.</p>
        <p>Go though the process of creating the namecheap account.</p>
        <p>After you have created an account and are logged in, 
            you can go back to the cart and Confirm Order.</p>
        <p>If the details look okay in the checkout page click Pay Now to register your
            domain.</p>
        <p>To view your domain go to the namecheap homepage and go into
            Account then Dashboard.</p>
        <p>The Dashboard should show the new domain name you purchased.</p>

    <h3>Important information about this process:</h3>
        <p>A web server is just a piece of softwared you run on your
            computer. GitHub is a Web Server but run on their computers.
            Live Server is also a web server.</p>
        <p>A web server can communicate with a browser. This is done
            by typing in a url.</p>
        <p>The browser can ask the web server for files.</p>
        <p>If you happen to get back an html file it will display the
            website instead of giving back the text of the file.</p> 
        <p>Web Servers need a computer for it to run. The computer running
            the web server is called a host.</p>
        <p>Web Hosting Company provides you with computers to run
            the web servers and the server software.</p>
        <p>The ip address is given anytime the internet is accessed.</p>
        <p>The IP address like a phone number is able to be contacted
            by other devices connected to the internet. IP addresses
        are unique.</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of IP addresses:</p>           
        <ol>
            <li>IPv4 (4 has groups of typically 3 numbers seperated by decimals)</li>
            <li>IPv6 (has around 15 digits mostly numbers some letters seperated by colons)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Version 6 exist because ip addresses for version 4 are running out.</p>
        <p>We need to link our domain name to GitHub's ip address.</p>
        <p>We can set up a link between a domain name and an ip address in
            a Domain Registrar 
            (If you bought your domain name from namecheap it will be
            the one you purchased through them).</p>
        <p>The link between the Domain Registrar and the GitHub ip
            address is called a DNS record (Domain Name System Record).</p>

    <hr>        
    <br>
    <h3>How to Set up a DNS Record inside the Domain Registrar:</h3>
        <p>Login to your domain registrar 
            (namecheap if you bought your name there.)</p>
        <p>The remaining instructions for the domain registrar are
            using namecheap.</p>
        <p>Once logged in go to the Settings for the domain name.</p>
        <p>To go to Settings for the domain name in namecheap click on
            Domain List.</p>
        <p>Scroll down to the domain name you want to use.</p>
        <p>Click the Manage button to the right of the domain name.</p>
        <p>Click on the Advanced DNS tab.</p>
        <p>Scroll down to the table with headers of &#8220;Type&#8221;, &#8220;Host&#8221;,
            &#8220;Value&#8221;, and &#8220;TTL&#8221;.</p>
        <p>You can also look on Google for Manage dns records YourDomainRegistrarName</p>
        <p>Under the table there will be a &#8220;ADD NEW RECORD&#8221;
            button. Click this button.</p>
        <p>Fill in the values for the DNS record.</p>
        <p>The first value you will fill in is the Record type.</p>
        <p>For an ip address use an &#8220;A Record.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Next value will be the TTL value.</p>
        <p>TTL stands for TIme To Live. This refers to how
            long after chaning the DNS records before they change
            accross the internet. short TTL means the DNS changes will
            be updated very quickly. A long TTL means it will be updated
            more slowly. Long TTLs are a little more efficient but 
            for this project you can select 5 minutes. If it asks for
            seconds instead of minutes do 300 seconds which is 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Next the sub domain (Under the Host heading) is the part of the url in front of a domain
            name.</p>
        <p>We want the sub domain to be blank. To do this using namecheap
            we use the at (@) symbol.</p>
        <p>For other domain registrars you can just leave it blank.</p>
        <p>The last value needed is the IP Address (of GitHub Pages).</p>
        <p>To find the IP Address of GitHub Pages go to a new tab
            and search for dns lookup.</p>
        <p>The website you want will under https://mxtookbox.com</p> 
        <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx">
            DNS lookup tool (IPv4)</a>
        <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/IPv6.aspx">
            DNS lookup tool (IPv6)</a>
        <p>At this address you can search for a domain Name
            and see which IP addresses are currently linked to
            it.</p>
        <p>Type in the GitHub user name followed by .github.io
             in the Domain Name search bar.</p>
        <p>UserNameWithGitHub.github.io (This is the default
            name GitHub gives you)</p>
        <p>Click on DNS Lookup.</p>
        <p>It will show you the IP addresses associated with 
            GitHub Pages.</p>
        <p>For each IP address you will need to create a DNS record.</p>
        <p>First click on one of the IP address results in
             the DNS lookup tool.</p>
        <p>Then copy the IP address that appears on the left
            (the information after the ptr:)</p>
        <p>Paste the Copied IP address from the DNS lookup tool
            Into the IP Adress under the Value header of the
            namecheap page.</p>
        <p>If all four values are filled out click the green
            checkmark to Save Changes.</p>
        <p>Repeat the steps for filling in the values for the 
            reamining IP addresses that appeared in the DNS lookup tool.</p>
    
    <hr>        
    <br>
    <h3>Setting up the www sub-domain</h3>
        <p>The final step is to set up a sub-domain called www</p>
        <p>Although setting up the www is not required it is 
            recommended by GetHub Pages.</p>
        <p>In namecheap you will need to click on ADD NEW RECORD
            again in the settings of your Domain Name.</p>
        <p>Instead of an A Record like the other ones you set up,
            This record will be a CNAME Record.</p>
        <p>Record types Info:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A Record: Links a website to an IP address</li>
            <li>CNAME Record: Links a domain name to another domain name</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The CNAME makes it easier to link to GitHub Pages without
            having to know the specific ip addresses.</p>
        <p>In the sub-domain section (under the Host header)
            you will put www</p>
        <p>Under the Value header section (IP address section) 
            you will put your UserNameWithGitHub.github.io 
            (This is the default name GitHub gives you).</p>
        <p>In the TTL section you will choose 5 minutes
            (or 300 seconds).</p>
        <p>Click the checkmark to save the changes.</p>
        <p>You can only use CNAME Records for sub-domains</p>
        <p>You should setup IP addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6.
            IPv6 will start being used more in the future.</p>
    
    <hr>        
    <br>
    <h3>Tell GitHub Pages which domain name we want to use.</h3>
        <p>Go back to github.com and log on.</p>
        <p>Click on the profile picture in the top right after loggin in</p>
        <p>Choose your repositories</p>
        <p>Click on the repository name link to open it.</p>
        <p>Click on settings for the repository.</p>
        <p>Click on Pages.</p>
        <p>Scroll down to the Custom domain section and click in the 
            box to enter what domain name you want GitHub Pages to use.</p>
        <p>Enter in the domain name you set up earlier in the box.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>DomainName.com</p>
        <p>Then click Save.</p>
        <p>It can take some domain registars 24-48 hours for the 
            DNS records to update.</p>
        <p>Once Saved it will show the message: 
            &#8220;Your site is published at&#8220; followed by
        the website.</p>
        <p>You can also type this domain name in the url</p>
    
    <hr>    
    <br>
    <h3>Setting up HTTPS</h3>
        <p>Even though the site is live it is not secure.</p>
        <p>To secure it you need to set up HTTPS.</p>
        <p>HTTPS encripts all data flowing between the browser and the 
            website.</p>
        <p>To set up HTTPS go back to GitHub Pages.</p>
        <p>In the repository settings of your website scroll down 
            until you find the Enfoce HTTPS check box.</p>
        <p>Check the box.</p>
        <p>There is a behind the scenes process to set up HTTPS
          and it may take up to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Once the process is finished just refresh the page and
            the checkbox should be enabled (You still have to check it).</p>
        <p>Check the box and and it will say the DNS check is in progress.</p>
        <p>Now go back to your website url and type https:// in
            front of it.</p>
        <p>A lock icon will appear in front of the website indicating that
            the https is enabled.</p>
