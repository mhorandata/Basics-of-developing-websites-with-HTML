        <h1>How to upload HTML code to a website (GitHub Pages):</h1>

        <br>
        <h3>Creating a repository on github:</h3>

        <p>Go to github.com and log on. (create an account if you don't have one yet)</p>   
        <p>Next click on your icon in the upper right corner. To open the drop down menu.</p>
        <p>Select Your repositories. Repositories are like folders where files and documents can be stored.</p>
        <p>Click on new for new repository (has a little book with a bookmark icon next to it).</p>
        <p>Add a repository name that you can use to identify the repository with later.</p>
        <p>Make sure the repository is public.</p>
        <p>Leave everything else as is and click on Create repository.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Uploading code</h3>
        <p>In the Quick setup section of the new repository choose the link for &#8220;upload an existing file&#8221; 
            (You can also type /upload at the top of the repository web address)</p>
        <p>Now simply drag and drop files to the &#8220;Drag files here to add them to your repository&#8221; section
            or click on the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; hyperlink text to search for them on your computer.</p>
        <p>Don't drag the folder with the files of code into the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; section.
            Instead, only drag the files contianing the actual code into the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; section.</p>
        <p>Once files are added the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; will turn into the 
            &#8220;Drag additional files here to add them to your repository.&#8221; section.</p>     
        <p>The files should now show up below the &#8220;Drag additional files here to add them to your repository.&#8221; section.</p>
        <p>Click on &#8220;Commit changes&#8221; once you have the needed files uploaded.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>How to add the uploaded code to GitHub Pages:</h3>
        <p>From your repository's page click on Settings button in the top right.</p>
        <p>From Settings under the Code and automation section on the left choose Pages.</p>  
        <p>In GitHub Pages under the Source section in the middle click on the drop down that starts with &#8220;None&#8221; selected.</p>
        <p>In the drop-down choose &#8220;main&#8221; (It may be called something else like master but it should be the option that isn't
             &#8220;none&#8221;)</p>
        <p>Next to the drop down that now has Branch:main (unless main wasn't the name) leave the &#8220;/(root)&#8221; drop down as the default
            then click Save.</p>
        <p>The code will then publish to the internet. It make take a few minutes.</p>
        <p>After a few minutes you can refresh the page and it should say &#8220;Your site is published at&#8221; followed by a 
            hyperlink. Now anyone with that hyperlink on the internet can view our website.</p>
        <p>If you don not see the hyperlink you can also access it using your github_username.github.io/repository_name</p>
        <p>You can right click on the link in the GitHub Pages and open in a new tab to open the website in a new tab.</p>
        <p>When you open it likely it will have a 404 File not found error at this point.</p>
        <p>In the repository files you will have the names of your files. If you add a slash (/) then the name of one of the 
            files that are part of your html website and press enter it will take you to your website.</p>
        <p>The GitHub repository works the same way as the computer in that the files on GitHub in the repository link up
            using the file names found in the repository just like they do in Visual Studio Code. This is the same for 
            loading images which should be uploaded to the GitHub Repository and named as they are in Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>Steps to put the webstie on internet:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write HTML & CSS code</li>
            <li>Upload code to GitHub</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The 404 error mentioned before is because by default the website will look for a file called index.html.
            If this file is not uploaded to GitHub then it will return the error and you will have to manually add the file name.
            So to fix the problem we need to add an index.html file into our repository. You can rename a file to 
            index.html if you want that file to automatically open by default. It may take a few momenets after updating
            the name before the changes are finished loading. Once they have been updated if you refresh your website's
            page it will load without the 404 error and instead using the html code in the index.html file.</p>
