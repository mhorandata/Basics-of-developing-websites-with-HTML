        <h3>Creating a repository on github:</h3>

        <p>Go to github.com and log on. (create an account if you don't have one yet)</p>   
        <p>Next click on your icon in the upper right corner. To open the drop down menu.</p>
        <p>Select Your repositories. Repositories are like folders where files and documents can be stored.</p>
        <p>Click on new for new repository (has a little book with a bookmark icon next to it).</p>
        <p>Add a repository name that you can use to identify the repository with later.</p>
        <p>Make sure the repository is public.</p>
        <p>Leave everything else as is and click on Create repository.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Uploading code</h3>
        <p>In the Quick setup section of the new repository choose the link for &#8220;upload an existing file&#8221; 
            (You can also type /upload at the top of the repository web address)</p>
        <p>Now simply drag and drop files to the &#8220;Drag files here to add them to your repository&#8221; section
            or click on the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; hyperlink text to search for them on your computer.</p>
        <p>Don't drag the folder with the files of code into the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; section.
            Instead, only drag the files contianing the actual code into the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; section.</p>
        <p>Once files are added the &#8220;choose your files&#8221; will turn into the 
            &#8220;Drag additional files here to add them to your repository.&#8221; section.</p>     
        <p>The files should now show up below the &#8220;Drag additional files here to add them to your repository.&#8221; section.</p>
        <p>Click on &#8220;Commit changes&#8221; once you have the needed files uploaded.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>How to add the uploaded code to GitHub Pages:</h3>
        <p>From your repository's page click on Settings button in the top right.</p>
